#Algorithms and Coding Labs
Welcome to the Algorithms and Coding Labs repository! ðŸš€ This repository contains solutions to various lab problems and assignments from my university course labs on algorithms and coding. It showcases problem-solving techniques, algorithm implementations, and coding best practices.

ðŸ“š Repository Overview
This repository is organized into subfolders, each representing a specific lab or topic. Each folder contains:

Problem descriptions.
Code implementations in languages like C, C++, Python, etc.
Sample input/output files for testing.
Algorithm analysis and visualizations (if applicable).
Key Topics Covered:
Sorting Algorithms: Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, etc.
Dynamic Programming: Knapsack Problem, Longest Common Subsequence, etc.
Graph Algorithms: BFS, DFS, Dijkstra's Algorithm.
Advanced Topics: Fenwick Tree, Segment Tree, Max Flow.
Foundational Problems: Basics of recursion, arrays, and pointers.
These problems are taken directly from my university course labs to document my learning and showcase my understanding of algorithms and coding concepts.
