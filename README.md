## 📚 Repository Overview

This repository is organized into subfolders, each representing a specific lab or topic. Each folder contains:
- Problem descriptions.
- Code implementations in languages like **C**, **C++**, **Python**, etc.
- Sample input/output files for testing.
- Algorithm analysis and visualizations (if applicable).

### **Key Topics Covered**:
- **Sorting Algorithms**: Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, etc.
- **Dynamic Programming**: Knapsack Problem, Longest Common Subsequence, etc.
- **Graph Algorithms**: BFS, DFS, Dijkstra's Algorithm.
- **Advanced Topics**: Fenwick Tree, Segment Tree, Max Flow.
- **Foundational Problems**: Basics of recursion, arrays, and pointers.

These problems are taken directly from my university course labs to document my learning and showcase my understanding of algorithms and coding concepts.
